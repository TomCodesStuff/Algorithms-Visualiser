## Sorting Algorithms:

This table below shows the searching algorithms visualised by AVA. <br>
For each algorithm, instructional steps are provided which can be followed to produce working implementations.

Two helper functions `isSwapNeeded()` and `swap()` are defined which represent fundamental operations performed by each algorithm. <br> 
The specifics of their implementation are left to the reader.

### Merge Sort:

#### Algorithm Steps:

1. Repeatedly split the array into sub-arrays containing only one element 
2. Take pairs of sub-arrays
3. Merge both sub-arrays by comparing elements, creating a new larger sub-array.  
4. Repeat the merging process creating larger sorted sub-arrays 
5. Continue until only one sorted array remains 

#### Time-Space Complexities: 

Time Complexity: O(n log n) <br>
Space Complexity: O(n)


#### A Note On Space Complexity 

An O(1) space complexity can be achieved by merging the sub arrays in-place.

### Quick Sort:

#### Algorithm Steps: 

1. Set a variable `pivot = selectPivot()`
2. All elements < pivot: 
    \- Shifted to the left of the pivot 
3. All elementd > pivot: 
    \- Shifted to the right of the pivot 
4. Repeat the process on the left sub-array (elements to the left of the pivot)
5. Repeat the process on the right sub-array (elements to the right of the pivot)
6. Recurively repeat process until sub-arrays contain only a single element 


#### Time-Space Complexities: 

Time Complexity: O(n log n) <br>
Space Complexity: O(1)  

#### Pivot Selection 

Multiple different methods can be used to determine the pivot. <br> 
This project uses the <b>Median Of Three</b>; an explanation of this method and other pivot selection methods can be found [here.](https://dev.to/pineapples/writing-a-median-of-three-pivot-helper-for-quicksort-289m) 


#### A Note On Time Complexity 

If the pivot is not chosen efficiently, the worst case time complexity becomes O(n<sup>2</sup>)

### Selection Sort:

#### Algorithm Steps: 

1. for i in range(0, array.length()): 
2. Set variable `minIdx = i`
3. for j in range(i + 1, array.length()):
4. If isSwapNeeded(minIdx, j): <br>
    \- minIdx = j 
5. Set variable `value = array[minIdx]`
6. Shift all elements between `i` and `minIdx` one place to the right  
7. Set `array[i] = value`
8. End For Loop 
9. End For Loop

#### Time-Space Complexities: 

Time Complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)<br>
Space Complexity: O(1)

### Tim Sort:

#### Algorithm Steps: 

1. Set variable `runSize = calculateRunSize()`  
2. Perform Insertion Sort on each run 
3. Perform Merge Sort (The starting sub-arrays are the sorted runs). 

#### Time-Space Complexities: 

Time Complexity: O(n log n)<br>
Space Complexity: O(n) 

#### A Note On Space Complexity 

An O(1) space complexity can be achieved by merging the sub arrays in-place. 

#### Run Size Calculation

The official Tim Sort implementation uses run sizes in the range 32 - 64 (inclusive). <br>
For arrays that are smaller than 64 elements only an insertion sort is performed. <br> 
Further details on how run size is officially calculated can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort)

For the purposes of visulisation this project calculates the run size such that the number of runs is approximately <b>16</b>. <br>
For arrays shorter than 16 elements, only insertion sort is performed.
